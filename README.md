# Wince-Nail

![Screenshot of the game in play](https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvNTExODUvMjI1NzM1LnBuZw==/original/l2H0PX.png)

 Source code for [WINCE NAIL](https://nbnoemi.itch.io/wince-nail). See the link for information about the game.
 
 Everything here is built on top of a ~2016 version of the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) game development framework.
 
 This contains only original code written for the game. Libraries and assets were not included, and it used an old version of LÖVE so many 
 functions will likely have since been depracated. This WILL crash if you attempt to run it in LÖVE as-is.
 
 This cludgy old code made quickly under time constraints is being released as part of the attempt to port the underlying
 logic making up the SEPIA (Simple Environmental Puzzle Implementation for Adventures) system to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) framework
 as a simple and fun project to learn those technologies.
 
 Libraries that were excluded:
 * [HUMP](https://github.com/vrld/hump) was in the directory /hump/
 * [flux](https://github.com/rxi/flux/) was in the directory /animation/
 * [lovebird](https://github.com/rxi/lovebird) was in the directory /debug/
 
 If for whatever reason you find this code useful, feel free to use any aspect of it in your own projects. If you wish you can credit me as either Noemi Banks or @mimimalloc.
